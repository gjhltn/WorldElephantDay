🚨 Tomorrow - Saturday 12 August - is World Elephant Day 🚨

I'd like to invite you to help me celebrate, and to make a positive contribution to elephant conservation right now. 

It'll take you just as long as it takes to click a link, costs you nothing, raises money for elephants... and you might also learn some cool new stuff too.

THE PROBLEM

Elephants are at the sharp end of a perfect storm of threats: climate change, habitat loss, conflict with humans, and the ivory trade.

Over the last decade elephant numbers have fallen 62%. More elephants are killed every day for ivory alone than are born. If we don't do better, this will be their final decade on earth. They are disappearing under our watch.

HOW YOU CAN HELP

If you would like to join me and help out, I'd like to introduce you to the work of one particularly sepcial NGO on the ground in Keyna making a difference for elephants: If you take a minute between now and Monday to click through to their website, on your behalf I'll donate £1 to them for every click from a TPX-er.

That's all you have to do, click a link. No funny business, no cost to you, just click the link, it'll count your visit, and you'll be forwarded to their website. There's no catch. Help an elephant out by checking out their site, and as a thank you, I'll make a donation for you.

BETTER YET if you like what they do, and are inspired to support their work with a donation of your own, or by adopting an orphan elephant I WILL MATCH YOUR DONATION so they get double. Post your reciept here and I'll do the rest.

Please would you help out an elephant to celebrate World Elephant day?

THE LINK TO CLICK IS:
https://gjhltn.github.io/WorldElephantDay/ 

Hit it, and I'll donate £1 for you.

ps I threw the page togethr very quickly and its low-tech and home made - but its nothing fishy I promise, just a counter so i can keep track of clicks. Its all on github - nothing up my sleeves.

HOW YOU CAN HELP EVEN MORE

1) Tell another TPX-er about this. Let's see if we can get everybody in our big company family to raise £1!

2) Don't fall for scam elephant charities. If they encourqge you to touch or interact with - or worse, ride - an elephant they very likely aren't legit. Sorry!

3) Spread the word.

4) Any suggestions? I'm all ears.

5) ASK ME ANYTHING! If I dont know the answer I very likely know an elephant expert who does.

SMALL PRINT

I'm doing this because I love elephants, because i love this NGO and because I want to share both with you. Its a personal celebration, not endorsed by TPXImpact or by SWT, it's just me, Guy.

I'm hoping this catches on, but it's coming out of my back pocket and I'm just an ordinary person so I can only afford to sponsor clicks or match donations up to a maximum of the first £1000 in total. The counter lauched Friday AM and will run until close of play on Monday.

[posted here at the kind suggestion of Molly, and crossposted to #erg_allies, #erg_climate and #tpx_di_general - but all my fault if it doesnt belong here, apologies.] 

Thanks for reading, thanks for caring, thanks for clicking https://gjhltn.github.io/WorldElephantDay/ and helping an elephant!

HAPPY WORLD ELEPHANT DAY, TPXIMPACT!
